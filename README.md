# Project2

Project Idea: Personal Recipe Manager 
- an app for keeping all your favorite recipes in one place 
- an easy way to create a record of favorite recipe and to add new ones over time 

MVP: 
- a main page that shows all recipes with links (Read) 
- ability to click on each recipe and be taken to another page with more information (Read) 
- ability to edit and delete recipes on each recipe page (Update + Delete) 
- ability to add new recipes on main page (Create) 

Would be nice: 
- ability to create an account (sign up) 
- ability to login to account 
- pictures attached to each recipe
